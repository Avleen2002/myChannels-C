# myChannels: Multi-Threaded Channel Mixer
## Overview
myChannels is a multi-threaded program designed to process 16-bit integer input from multiple channels, applying optional low-pass filtering and amplification, and generating a mixed output. This README provides an overview of the project structure, usage instructions, and additional details for developers.

## Features
- Efficient multi-threaded processing of 16-bit integer input from diverse channels.
- Dynamic thread creation and task coordination for optimal resource utilization.
- Buffered file reading with optional low-pass filtering and amplification.
- Support for checkpointing and lock mechanisms to ensure synchronized progress.
